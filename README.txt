*******************************************************************************/

Overview: For this project I was given a grammar and list of rules to check against the Lexical Analyzer code I have written. What this projects purpose is is to take in Scheme code and traverse the rules I have implemented following the given grammar and output the corresponding rules used.

For this project, what I have written seems to pass all test cases. I dont believe there are any bugs and everything
seems to work as intended. My program outputs corresponding rules for lines in a given .ss file and produces a .p2 file
for the list of rules and a .dbg file for debugging purposes.

Further work:
-Continue to test and verify output
